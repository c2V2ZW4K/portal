# Portal of Knowledge  
One collection of knowledge and utillity tools about  
                  nuclear elements  
                  energy molecules  
                  fission process  
                  Formation of Materia / Elements  
                  
   
# /dev/
   |___>  Generator of Molecules: Generate molecules with random generation
  
          Molecules research: uses one cross-site of anonchatgpt to make research about the molecule  the button connect/disconnect then if you don't use this the site not make connection
  
          Molecules Viwer: to reproduce one visualization with the interpretation of formula of your molecule
          IMG > Base64: To convert one image in string base64
          CSV Generator: This generate one .CSV that contain the proprierties of your molecule
          CSV to HTML: This generate with basis in the .CSV one html visualization of proprierties of molecule
