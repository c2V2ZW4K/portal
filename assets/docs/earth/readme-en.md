# Center Axis Gravity

- Gravity around the Earth's axis is responsible for keeping the planet in its orbit around the Sun
     and by the attraction of objects on its surface. The Earth revolves around its axis,
      which is inclined with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun,
       causing the seasons.

- The Moon's gravity also influences the Earth, creating a tidal bulge that tries to rotate at the same speed as the rest of the planet.
     In addition, the Moon's gravity causes a small periodic variation in the Earth's rotational axis that occurs every 18.6 years, known as nutation,
      and can influence the position of the Earth's poles. However, gravity around the Earth's axis
       is essentially the same at all points on the surface of the planet, except for small variations
        due to factors such as the altitude and density of the Earth in different regions

# nutation
- Nutation is a periodic movement of the direction of the axis of rotation of an astronomical object,
     like Earth, which causes a variation in the orientation of the axis of rotation over time.
      It is an oscillation that occurs about the precession of the Earth's axis,
       which is the slow, continuous change in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation caused by the gravitational influence of the Moon and Sun.
        Nutation is caused by the gravitational forces of other celestial bodies acting on the rotating object, such as Earth, and occurs every 18.6 years.
         Nutation is an important phenomenon in astronomy as it affects the position of the Earth's poles and can influence the accuracy of astronomical measurements.

## SCI-FI Terra Slip
- Create a new axis for one of the divided halves of the Earth, using sci-fi terms,
    it can be an interesting and imaginative task. I will elaborate on an idea based on this premise:
    
    Imagine that, in the distant future, humanity has developed advanced technology capable of manipulating Earth's gravitational forces.
     Using this technology, a powerful faction decides to create a new axis of rotation for one of the planet's halves.

    To accomplish this feat, they develop a gigantic device called a "Gravitational Axis Generator" (GEG).
     The GEG is installed in a strategic location and activated, starting to generate a special gravitational field around it.
    As the GEG's gravitational field intensifies, it begins to exert a significant influence on Earth's rotation.
     Gradually, the current axis of rotation changes, moving towards the desired half.

    However, this action has dramatic consequences.
     Redistribution of land mass and shift in axis of rotation cause catastrophic seismic events, triggering earthquakes,
      volcanic eruptions and tsunamis around the world. Humanity is confronted with a global crisis,
       as it struggles to adapt to seismic changes and deal with the resulting devastation.
   
    As the new axis of rotation stabilizes, the affected half of Earth experiences a complete geographic reconfiguration.
     Continents split and collide, oceans change size and new landscapes emerge. Entire ecosystems are transformed,
      and humanity needs to adapt to a new environment.

    This new half of Earth becomes an unexplored and mysterious terrain, full of natural wonders and unique challenges.
     Human society reorganizes itself over the centuries, establishing new cities, governments and cultures adapted to the conditions of this new world.
      Precious resources are discovered, spurring a race among nations to explore and colonize these newly created lands.

    In this sci-fi setting,
     the creation of a new axis for one half of the Earth triggers a series of dramatic events that shape the history and destiny of humanity.
     This provides an opportunity to explore themes such as exploration, adaptation, geopolitical conflicts and the transformative potential of technology.
