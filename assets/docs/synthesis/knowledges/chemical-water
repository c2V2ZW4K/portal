The chemical formula for the synthesis of water from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas is:

2H2 + O2 â†’ 2H2O

This equation represents the balanced chemical reaction for the formation of water.
It states that two molecules of hydrogen gas (H2) react with one molecule of oxygen gas (O2) to produce two molecules of water (H2O).

To reproduce water in a laboratory setting, you would need the following
tools and technology:

Gas cylinders: Obtain compressed hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) from reliable sources in gas cylinders.

Gas regulators: Attach gas regulators to the gas cylinders to control the flow of hydrogen and oxygen gases.

Gas tubing and connectors: Connect the gas cylinders to a reaction vessel using appropriate gas tubing and connectors.
                           Ensure that the tubing and connectors are suitable for handling flammable gases.

Reaction vessel: Use a suitable reaction vessel that can withstand the pressure and temperature of the reaction.
                 A glass or metal container with a tight-fitting lid or stopper can be used.

Ignition source: Provide an ignition source to initiate the reaction, such as a spark or flame.
                  However, exercise extreme caution when handling ignition sources near flammable gases.

Safety measures: Ensure proper ventilation in the laboratory to prevent the accumulation of explosive gas mixtures.
                  Work in a controlled environment with fire safety measures in place, such as fire extinguishers and a fire blanket.

Step-by-step procedure:

Set up the reaction vessel: Place the reaction vessel on a stable surface in the laboratory.
                            Attach the gas tubing and connectors to the vessel, ensuring a secure and airtight connection.

Purge the reaction vessel: Purge the reaction vessel with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, to remove any air or contaminants.

Add hydrogen gas: Open the valve of the hydrogen gas cylinder and adjust the gas flow using the gas regulator.
                  Allow hydrogen gas to flow into the reaction vessel until the desired amount is reached.

Add oxygen gas: Open the valve of the oxygen gas cylinder and adjust the gas flow using the gas regulator.
                 Allow oxygen gas to flow into the reaction vessel in a stoichiometric ratio with hydrogen gas (2:1).

Ignite the mixture: Using a safe ignition source,
                    carefully ignite the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases inside the reaction vessel.
                    Exercise extreme caution during this step.

Observe the reaction: The ignited mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases will react and produce water vapor (H2O).
                      You may observe a flame and/or condensation of water vapor on the walls of the reaction vessel.

Collect the water: Allow the reaction to proceed until the reaction vessel cools down.
                   Collect the water vapor that has condensed on the walls of the vessel or use appropriate methods for water collection.

To create water from hydrogen and oxygen in a laboratory setting, you can follow the steps and precautions mentioned in the initial query.
Here are some additional tips and steps to ensure a safe and successful 
experiment:

Additional Safety Measures:
                           Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE):
                            Wear safety goggles, gloves, and a lab coat to protect yourself from potential hazards during the experiment

Use a fume hood:
                Conduct the experiment in a fume hood to ensure proper ventilation and containment of any potential hazards1

Use a flashback arrestor:
                        Install a flashback arrestor on the gas tubing to prevent the flame from traveling back into the gas cylinders2

Monitor the gas concentrations:
                                Use gas detectors to monitor the concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen in the laboratory.
                                This will help you maintain a safe environment and avoid the formation of explosive gas mixtures

Additional Steps

Determine the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio:
                                            Calculate the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for the hydrogen-oxygen reaction
                                              to ensure the correct proportions of gases are used

Control the gas flow rates:
                           Use flow meters and controllers to accurately control the flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen gases into the reaction vessel

Monitor the reaction temperature:
                                  Use a temperature sensor to monitor the temperature inside the reaction vessel.
                                    This will help you ensure that the reaction is proceeding as expected and avoid overheating

Use a water trap:
                  Install a water trap in the gas tubing to collect the water produced during the reaction.
                  This will make it easier to collect the water and prevent it from entering the gas cylinders

Purify the collected water:
                           If necessary, purify the collected water using appropriate filtration or purification methods to remove any impurities

By following these additional steps and precautions,
you can safely and effectively create water from hydrogen and oxygen in a laboratory setting.
Remember to always prioritize safety and work under the supervision of an experienced professional
when conducting experiments with flammable gases.
