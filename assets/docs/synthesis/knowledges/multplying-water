For first is necessary understand that the waker cannot be moved to the space in the liquid condition.
then is necessary freeze and after transport until the any location.

To multiply the amount of ice, one can follow these steps:

1. Fill a container with water and place it in a freezer until it freezes into ice.
2. Remove the container from the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to allow the ice to slightly melt and loosen from the container.
3. Carefully remove the ice from the container and place it in another container.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 to create more ice.

It is important to note that when water freezes, it expands and its volume increases by approximately 9.05%[1][2].
Therefore, it is important to use a container that can accommodate the expansion of the water as it freezes.
Additionally, it is important to let the ice slightly melt before removing it from the container to avoid damaging the ice or the container.

Additional thinks:
  The older common home refrigerator use one engine with one little amount of gas to make the process of refrigeration inside pf refrigerator
    most intensified in the "freezer" container as is called
    multiply the ice inside your container and if the ice is water then this make the process of multiplication of water in various ambients
    turning possible the fact of produce in other planets faar of solar system or as mars.

Multiplication:   
1_ The acceleration of process count with the mixture of ice,salt and water that increase the process of freeze and accelerate.

2_ Hydrogen gas can be transformed into liquid hydrogen through a process called liquefaction.
      The process involves cooling the gas to below -253°C (-423°F), which is the boiling point of hydrogen, to form a liquid[1][2].
        Liquefaction is done by cooling a gas to form a liquid. It takes energy to liquefy hydrogen, and using today's technology,
        liquefaction consumes more than 30% of the energy content of the hydrogen and is expensive[2]. Once hydrogen is liquefied,
        it can be stored at the liquefaction plant in large insulated tanks. Liquid hydrogen has been used as a fuel in space technology for several years[1].
        Trucks transporting liquid hydrogen are referred to as liquid tankers[2].
