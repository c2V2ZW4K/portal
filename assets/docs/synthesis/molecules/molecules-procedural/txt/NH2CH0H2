the formula NH2CHOH2. It consists of an amino group (NH2), a hydroxyl group (OH), and a methylene group (CH2).
The molecule is commonly known as aminoethanol or ethanolamine.

Here's the structural representation of NH2CHOH2:

In this structure, the central carbon atom (C) is bonded to two hydrogen atoms (H), an amino group (NH2),
and a hydroxyl group (OH). The remaining bonds of the carbon atom are filled by two additional hydrogen atoms (H).

Aminoethanol is an important compound in biochemistry and is commonly used in the production of various chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.
It can act as a building block for larger organic molecules
and is often used as a precursor in the synthesis of drugs and surfactants.
