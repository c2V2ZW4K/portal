Ivy Mike Bomb Recreation Steps
-----------------------------
Name: Ivy Mike
Year: 2077
Designer: Ogiva

Initial Steps:
- Design and construction: Designed and constructed by Ogiva.
- Fission reaction: Initiate nuclear fission using enriched plutonium or uranium core.: Gun-type design: Sub-critical mass fired into larger, supercritical mass.
- Compression and implosion: Compress and implode deuterium capsule around lithium-6 core.:
  - Deuterium capsule: Prepare deuterium capsule.
  - Lithium-6 core: Place lithium-6 core inside the capsule.
  - Compression mechanism: Develop compression mechanism.
  - Implosion initiation: Initiate rapid implosion of the capsule.
- Nuclear fusion: Extreme compression and implosion cause deuterium fusion, producing helium-4 and releasing massive energy.:
  - Extreme compression: Implosion mechanism creates extreme compression.
  - Fusion reaction initiation: Trigger nuclear fusion between deuterium and lithium-6 atoms.
  - Helium-4 production: Production of helium-4 nuclei.
  - Release of energy: Massive release of energy in the form of photons and kinetic energy.
- Termonuclear effect: Fusion releases 10.4 megatons of TNT energy.

Additional Steps:
- Radiation effects: Widespread ionizing radiation and radioactive fallout.
- Blast wave: Generates destructive shockwave.
- Fireball formation: Massive fireball from intense heat.
- Mushroom cloud formation: Distinctive mushroom-shaped cloud from rapid ascent and cooling of vaporized material.
- Environmental impact: Long-lasting contamination and environmental consequences.
- Humanitarian considerations: Raises ethical and humanitarian concerns.
